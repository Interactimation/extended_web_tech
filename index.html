 <h2>In this course, we'll explore a number of toolkits, and combine at least two:</h2>

<b>A-Frame</b>
<p>
  <a href="https://aframe.io/docs/1.7.0/introduction/" target="_blank">A-Frame</a> is a web framework for building virtual reality (VR) experiences. Built on top of HTML and completely wrapping <a href="https://threejs.org/" target="_blank">three.js</a>, it offers a powerful entity-component framework that provides declarative, extensible, and composable immersive experiences for the web.
</p>

<b>p5.js</b>
<p>
  A port of the artist-friendly programming language <a href="https://processing.org/" target="_blank">Proce55ing</a> (these days, spelled more traditionally, without the 5s) into a javascript library, <a href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5.js</a>, offers a robust toolkit for creating generative, and procedural works of interactive audiovisual art.   
</p>

<b>Tone.js</b>
<p>
  Though p5.js has its own method for addressing the Web Audio Api, we'll probably use the special-made toolkit <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/docs/15.1.22/index.html">Tone.js</a>, in combination with p5.js and possibly A-Frame or its core, three.js.

<h3>Sample Projects and Tutorials</h3>

<b>A-Frame: Starter Scene</b>
<p>
  <a href="aframe-intro.html" target="_blank">Featuring animation and image textures,</a> this is a great place to start
</p>

<b>A-Frame: Parent/Child Relationships</b>
<p>
  <a href="aframe-parent.html" target="_blank">Featuring the parent/child relationship,</a> think about making parents that have no geometry applied. How might that be an advantage? 
</p>

<b>A-Frame: Walking Project</b>
<p>
  <a href="walking-project.html" target="_blank">Parent/child person</a> will walk around the scene
</p>

<b>p5.js: My "Collections"</b>

<p>
  <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/markbaldridge/collections" target="_blank">Featuring some of the work I've made for students</a> this is a great place to start
</p>

<p>
  <a href="p5js_test.html" target="_blank">Compare this to examples in the editor</a> to see how to port work to our sites

<h3>Resources</h3>

<h4>Free Textures and Maps</h4h4>
<p>
  <b>Brian</b> offers <a href="https://freepbr.com/" target="_blank">free, seamless, image textures and various "maps"</a>, like "normal maps" which can give the illusion of surface detail
</p>

<h4>A-Frame Tutorials</h4>
<p>
  <b>Danilo</b> has some good tutorials about A-Frame, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUwvKXPlnJY" target="_blank">this one, on materials</a>, part of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8MkBHej75fJD-HveDzm4xKrciC5VfYuV" target="_blank">a playlist</a> with almost 30 videos! (13 are "hidden" —I dunno if he want's to make a dime off them)
</p>

<h4>p5.js Tutorials</h4>

<p>
  <b>Daniel Shiffman</b>, author of an influential book, <a href="https://natureofcode.com/introduction/" target="_blank">The Nature of Code</a>, also has a YouTube channel, _The Coding Train_, with tons of tutorials <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70MQ-FugwbI&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZV4yEcW3uDwOgGXKUUsPOM" target="_blank">including this playlist</a>
  </p>

    <b>Steve's Makerspace</b> has a playlist on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnJOmsprq3bE0QLbe7wZ8yb1-Dt0FBcP5" target="_blank">"generative art"</a> which is art that generates on the spot, based on certain parameters. He has a peculiar approach to color so you might start with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSDUMZRYWRU" target="_blank">2: Color in p5.js: How to Code Generative Art</a>. Or you can jump ahead to any topic that interests you!
