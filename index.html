 <h2>In this course, we'll explore a number of toolkits, and combine at least two:</h2>

<b>A-Frame</b>
<p>
  <a href="https://aframe.io/docs/1.7.0/introduction/" target="_blank">A-Frame</a> is a web framework for building virtual reality (VR) experiences. Built on top of HTML and completely wrapping <a href="https://threejs.org/" target="_blank">three.js</a>, it offers a powerful entity-component framework that provides declarative, extensible, and composable immersive experiences for the web.
</p>

<b>p5.js</b>
<p>
  A port of the artist-friendly programming language <a href="https://processing.org/" target="_blank">Proce55ing</a> (these days, spelled more traditionally, without the 5s) into a javascript library, <a href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5.js</a>, offers a robust toolkit for creating generative, and procedural works of interactive audiovisual art.   
</p>

<b>Tone.js</b>
<p>
  Though p5.js has its own method for addressing the Web Audio Api, we'll probably use the special-made toolkit <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/docs/15.1.22/index.html">Tone.js</a>, in combination with p5.js and possibly A-Frame or its core, three.js.
